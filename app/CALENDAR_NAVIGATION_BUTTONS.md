- `admin` or `is_superuser` → Admin Timetable

### Visibility Rules
- **Navbar buttons**: Only visible to authenticated users
- **Hero section buttons**: Only visible to authenticated users (teachers, students, admins)
- Buttons only appear for users who have the appropriate role

### Styling
- **Navbar**: Standard nav-link style with Font Awesome calendar icon
- **Hero Section**: Large green button (`btn-success btn-lg`) matching other hero CTAs
- Both include calendar icon for visual consistency

### Multi-language Support
All button labels are translatable and support both English and Arabic through the translation system.
